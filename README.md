i think that the best and the most effective project that you can do with the css 3D is probably a 3d room. but you might think oh man this is difficult and it takes time so, i would say no as an answer.
now why? becuse i was think like this until i made on within 3 days for reall. it just about 2500 line of style and about 500 of <div> funy right. enyway, all the code is avalible here make sure you follow me and donlowad the zip file then enjoy.
